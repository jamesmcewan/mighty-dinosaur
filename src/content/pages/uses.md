## Setup

For the last twenty or so years, I've been a Mac person, prior to that, a die-hard PC fan, but I fell in love with Unix-flavoured operating systems.

At the moment, I use a MacBook Pro for work and a 15in M2 MacBook Air personally.

Recently, I've been experimenting with a homelab setup, really just a couple of Raspberry Pi units with [Runtipi](https://runtipi.io) installed on them to manage Docker containers. I'm finding I like being able to run certain services in my own environment and using [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) as a private VPN to access externally.

### Editor

I live in the terminal these days. My editor of choice is Vim, more specifically Neovim.

For me, after getting over the learning curve (which admittedly was _years_), the modal style of editing finally clicked, and now I find it the most efficient way to work with text.

- editor: [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) w/[LazyVim config](https://www.lazyvim.org/)
- terminal emulator: [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/)
- shell: [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) with [Oh-My-Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) and [Starship prompt](https://starship.rs/)
- fonts: [Berkeley Mono](https://berkeleygraphics.com/typefaces/berkeley-mono/)
- theme of choice: [Tokyo Night - Night](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim)

From time to time I like an IDE and honestly [Nova](https://nova.app) from [Panic](https://panic.com) is really nice.

## Other tools

- browser: [Safari](https://apple.com/safari) - Honestly pretty much covers everything I need from a browser these days and features wise it's catching up.
- graphics: [Sketch](https://sketch.com) and [Acorn](https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/)

## Built with

This site uses [Astro](https://astro.build) as the framework of choice. I love the build speed, and the Astro templating language is great.

Styling wise, I'm using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), which I've been using for a while now. As an old CSS hand, it took me a while to get used to the utility-first approach, but now I find it a great way to work for me.

Everything holds together with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) and Node.js.

Hosting, CDN, and DNS handled through [Bunny.net](https://bunny.net) - they're a fantastic and inexpensive EU based platform.
