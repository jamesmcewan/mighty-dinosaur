These are among my favourite comic books both current and classic. I've been reading since I was 2 years old, so that's a lot to refine!

## Compact Comics

A recent development in the field and my new favourite format. These are not only a hell of a deal, but are great for throwing in a backpack.

import ComicsBlock from '../../components/block/comics-block.astro'

<ComicsBlock category="compact-comics" />

## Energon Universe

It's 2025 and my the series of books I follow the most closely are based on Transformers and GI Joe...is this a mid-life crisis (on infinite earths)?
