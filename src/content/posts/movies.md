After about a decade or so of going streaming first, I've decided to get back into owning my media. There's a couple of well-trodden factors for the why, but honestly I just missed the _collecting_ and being able to look at a shelf and see the things that matter to me.

However, in the heyday of dvds I honestly had too many. There were films I only watched once, or never watched at all (looking at you movie series box sets) so I need some rules.

So far these are my (loose) criteria:

1. Only buy something I’d re-watch.
2. No movie box sets
3. Ideally 4k or a special edition.

So here's where my collection currently stands.

- Alien
- Aliens
- Alien Romulus
- The Terminator
- Robocop
- Escape from New York
- Thief
- It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World
- Runaway Train
- Sorcerer
- Matinee
- Police Story
- Police Story 2
- Police Story III: Supercop
- The Iron Giant
- Spider-man: Across the Spider-Verse
- Superman: The Movie
- Superman II
- Memories
- Lupin III: the First
- Promare
- Contact
- Close Encounters of the Third Kind
- Raiders of the Lost Arc
- Spider-man
- Spider-man 2
