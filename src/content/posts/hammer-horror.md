![Photo of Edinburgh Castle with moody gothic vibes](https://static.mightydinosaur.dev/posts/hammer_castle.webp)

I've been experimenting with [!Camera](https://notbor.ing/product/camera) for the past few weeks. I love the lush filmic processing this adds to point and shoot iPhone photography.

This one in particular added a nice gothic quality to a photo of Edinburgh Castle that reminded me a lot of how classic Hammer Horror outdoor footage looked.
